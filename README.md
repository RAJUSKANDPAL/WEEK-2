# WEEK-2
This GitHub repository provides a brief yet clear documentation on IP and MAC addressing. It covers IP addressing and subnetting for both IPv4 and IPv6, including subnet creation using natural masks, custom masks, and CIDR notation, along with host calculations. It also explains MAC addressing and the role of ARP and RARP in resolving IP and MAC address mappings within a network.
